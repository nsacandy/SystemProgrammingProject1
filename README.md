To run Version1, type the following the command line from the project's source folder:
cargo run --bin Version1

Alternatively, to run version 2, do the following:
cargo run --bin Version2

The multithreaded version is performing quicker than version 1! 
On one run, we saw Version1 complete in 0.014 seconds, and Verson2 in 0.0064 seconds!
There is definitely performance gain from multithreading.
